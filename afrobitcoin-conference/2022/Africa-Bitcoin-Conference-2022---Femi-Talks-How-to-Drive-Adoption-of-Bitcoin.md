 So there's a lot of work that's happening now starting to be around education of Bitcoin developers and that's necessary. We need people who can build with technology. There's a lot of work at the other end of the spectrum which is around educating the end users about Bitcoin. I think that's as good with the caveats. I think what will actually drive adoption is not if you tell people that they can use to build with Bitcoin. I think what is a big gap is that in the process of creating a product, there are lots of other expertise that are necessary where people need to understand the Bitcoin philosophy. So you need user experience people who need product managers. You understand Bitcoin philosophy. You need product testers who understand Bitcoin philosophy. You need copyrighters to understand Bitcoin philosophy. You need product managers to understand Bitcoin philosophy. Who is teaching them? At the moment there is that gap. And when it comes to utility and seeing, we're taking one approach, most cases, which is less built the Bitcoin only version of a popular app. So I'm going to build a boat power or an Uber powered by Bitcoin. I think perhaps the big end and a fast end probably is smarter way to go. It's to actually see how do we get Bitcoin integration in every single popular app on the face of the planet. So what if meta and Facebook had an entire thing that's around the Bitcoin integration? Or Uber having an entire thing about Bitcoin integration? Or Airbnb having an entire thing of Bitcoin integration? Then Bitcoin has been start thinking about viable careers in these other organizations. So that's when I'm training the people and not only looking to match them into Bitcoin exchanges and very technical platforms only, which are very few. But I can also find out for them in traditional films where they are at the heart of the Bitcoin scene that's driving Bitcoin adoption. I think that way Bitcoin then becomes something that is utilitarian, that fits into people's lifestyle. And you have all a whole swath of people in society who have careers, which has a very good intersection of their technical expertise, but that there has their Bitcoin as a, and the understand, philosophy that drove the creation and drives the Bitcoin around the technology. Yeah, I agree with that.
