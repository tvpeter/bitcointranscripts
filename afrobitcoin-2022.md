 So for the next three days, we're going to be hearing from some of the biggest names in Bitcoin who actually see the recent implosion of FTX is another example that sets Bitcoin apart from the thousands of other altcoin projects and personally from these centralized crypto platforms because remember that the coin network focuses on two big things Decentralization and security and so sentiment is really positive here about the future of the industry because they feel that people around the world Are realizing that Bitcoin is more secure than other altcoin with more reliable and it's decentralized meaning that these centralized actors Can't mess with your money now blocks the EO Jack Thorcy strike the EO Jack molars and Ray Yuzaf who runs packed for one of the most prominent Decentralized crypto exchanges on the continent will all be speaking this week as will some of the biggest name Enlightening is that layer two technology built on top of Bitcoin that tried to replace existing fiat payment rails by making cash transfers around the world instantaneous Instantly settled and cheaper and crucially we're also hearing from Entrepreneurs based in the region who have been leaning into crypto as a way to make life easier What about the real-term applications of crypto? Mackenzie can an action are the people down there saying that it could actually make things better or easier than fiat cash? Yeah, so several countries in Africa Ghana Nigeria and Kenya same a few are these prime examples of places where Grassroots totally organic crypto adoption is happening because it's just better than the existing system There's a thriving peer-to-peer crypto payment network across the continent using a combination of Bitcoin and US dollar peg stable coins like Tether we're also talking about Bitcoin as it's saving technology because yes, it's price is volatile But in countries where there's rampant inflation and the local currency has lost most of its value Bitcoin can become the staper and more that's a blossom now mining for Bitcoin in some cases is creating a financial Inventive build infrastructure to harness stranded renewable energy and then make that power accessible to communities through Microgrids another point here steam others a delegation from legos led by Bernard Para And what's especially interesting about Nigeria is that the government has outright banned crypto very hostile to it yet The market is absolutely thriving a lot of Nigerians. I've spoken with deep Bitcoin as a tool in fighting back Against an oppressive government, but these are the use cases that people on the ground here are really excited about How is blog positioning itself to support? Activists that are the front front of fighting for social justice And how important is it for you to see Bitcoin serve the community? When one of the reasons we did that and thank you Alex and the HRF for for setting that up We're we are kind of solving our own problem And often when you solve your own problem you're solving other people's problem as well One of the problems we have in our company is that not everyone like again? We're in this bubble in the United States So people in our company seek Bitcoin as like this digital gold thing and price So we have a lot of people in the company that are against us working on Bitcoin for a variety of reasons and I appreciate that Because it always helps make our answer much stronger but one of the things we want to do is show like There are use cases here today that people are using Bitcoin for today that are extremely important that show off and showcase the best of humanity and And if our purpose is economic empowerment Why are we not listening to these people and why are we not bringing them up on stage? to tell us about what they're going through and why they found this and why it's important to them and In conversations with with Alex and others we determined that this shouldn't just be for our company as an audience It should be for whoever wants to see it. So That's why we we produce it but to to your point like When you focus on the concept of building for necessity, then I Mean there's no greater than an activist. There's there's no greater class of folks who? who can demonstrate a real need and a need in such a focus way that you can identify a problem and a series of technologies and and Interfaces that can actually help solve that problem. So Again, we don't want to approach every single problem with the Bitcoin hammer. We want to look at the problems that people are having and figure out if Bitcoin Potentially solves it in a differentiated way and often that answer is yes, it does but the amazing thing about a number of activists we've intersected with is that They bring the Bitcoin use case to us in the conversation. That's not us saying. We'll have you tried Bitcoin is like They're they're talking about the you know the usefulness of it, which is incredible and certainly Different from my experience of the conversation five years ago So I think the word is getting out and it's getting out because people are showing how they use it not telling people They're not telling people about the virtues of Bitcoin. They're showing people and that is the best way to spread anything it's like tangibly make people feel it and Activists are a big part of Enabling that because you you connect with their story because you connect at a human level because of their fight And you see the soul of what they're trying to do and you you can't help but feel their struggle And if they're bringing this tool in front of you I'm saying this salt my struggle. I don't care what it is dissolved it Yeah, that wins. I need to bring Bernard from bit knob up here It's the it's the coolest thing in the world man It's a the concept of Bitcoin as a network I got to be able to pay someone's lightning invoice, right? Like I have to be able to send I can take a customer's dollars and I can send a Bitcoin payment But send a Bitcoin payment to who the transfer wise network has one participant. It's transfer wise, right? The Swift network has limited participants at central banks Bernard and bit knob is the whole reason we're able to settle value in other currencies and in other continents Because they're on lightning too So it's a network open networks win and I told them I was I was like what how do you want to do the announcement for this conference? Say you got to do it. I said I'm not doing it without you getting up here with me, man It doesn't feel it don't feel right So I don't know if you want anything to say but it's a it's an open network And it's inspiring to be able to connect with people all over the world over an open protocol and build innovative products that Central like a central bank has no chance of building what we just built we did it in a month and we're how old are you? Yes Like I said yesterday with Bitcoin is like we work for each other right? like these eliminates the concept of correspondent banking, right and Again, this saves us a lot of money. It means that right now Somebody can send money from the US to Nigeria and it actually settles and they don't have to actually touch Bitcoin themselves, so if anyone tells you oh, it's volatile this isn't that's like that's in the past, right? If business is in Africa can't send their money out and it's stopping them from coming to the business in Africa Then it's bad for us But if they can come to business and they have their assurance that there's a payments real that actually sends their money back To places like the US then it improves commas and trade for us and for us at Vietnam does something You know which really trying to keep on solving great to work with you my friend Yes So if you're If you're in the United States and you need to get money to Africa you could use strike it'll get there in one minute It'll get there with it's cheaper faster than anything you've ever seen there's actually no other American company that can get money into Nigeria So we're proud to be the only one right now. Let's fucking go And if you're a business Call Bernard call me if you have money stuck in this continent if you need more efficient ways if you don't want to pay 40% I'll tell you what so the cheaper cashers in the world. I don't charge 40% I could charge a lot cheaper than that
