i know young nick in the front in the
front row here is having a good time
always front and center
so um you know this is amazing we're in
the back stage before we come on
everyone seems to be remarking like i
can't believe this all of this the
lights the venue this many people
and it's awesome and i'm having a great
time and i hope you are too
but the
the shame almost is that there are
certain parts of the world that don't
have this they don't have all this
access to education and they certainly
don't have access to all the means to
participate in this you know there's so
many parts of the world where you know
we might be engaging with bitcoin
because we see opportunity we want to
contribute to that hopeful future that
we see
but a lot of people don't have access to
the existing financial rails so bitcoin
is literally a lifeline for them they're
able to access a global liquid market of
value exchange without any intermediary
you don't need an id you don't need a
bank account
all you have to do is join the network
and you can participate in this global
global phenomenon
and so our next speaker is going to talk
about that in particular what's going on
in africa so i'd like you all to help me
give a warm welcome to software engineer
and founder of the bitcoin education
academy mr fodey
[Music]
job you guys hear me
all right
uh
senegal is in the building
thank you so much for having me here
today um last year i was not too far
from here in wynwood i was sitting in
the crowd so for me to be standing here
today giving this keynote is nothing
short but amazing so thank you so much
for having me i really appreciate it
so
i've been sitting in the back listening
to all the talks i didn't hear once
somebody mentioned africa somehow
someway
so i want to always talk about what i
deeply care about which is the african
continent
and bitcoin obviously
i call my talk africa's bitcoin moment
because last year
while i was here
i heard uh
jack mullers from strike and uh the
president buchelle mentioned legal
tender in el salvador so i just took off
went to el salvador because i wanted to
see what would happen before bitcoin and
after bitcoin adoption and see what i
can learn to maybe apply in senegal and
what i saw in el salvador was so amazing
because i have never seen so many people
go to a country and wish nothing but
best for that particular country
bitcoins are amazing so
i want to see how we can replicate this
on the african continent all right
so
i know gladstein has talked about a lot
about
the frank cfa problem in west africa we
have this currency that's shared by 15
countries but which is unfortunately
made by france in the south of france
and it's really messed up
so please check out bitcoin magazine's
monetary
colonialism or vastly new book check
your financial privilege or reasons
magazines documentary short piece on
this particular problem
so to make things like a little bit
clearer
let's basically compare two currencies
in africa the one on the left called the
city is for ghana and the one on the
right is called the frank cfa and is
shared by 15 countries in west africa
what are the main differences well if
you look at the city
it's made by ghanaians and it's for
ghanaians
the frank cfa was made by france
by the french people four africans in
south of france
ghana has been named two years ago or
three years ago i think it is even
higher now amongst the top 10 fastest
growing economies in 2019
none of the 15 countries that use the
frank cfa in africa
rank in the particular list and it's a
shame
the city is a floating currency kind of
it's kind of like protect to the dollar
a little bit but it's not too bad but
the frank cfa was pegged against the
french franc back in the days and then
once when they went to euro they pegged
it against the euro and that has
consequences as well
now
the city could be evaluated technically
but only if it benefits the african
people in ghana
the french the french cfa could be
evaluated by france like for myself when
i got here in 94 to go to college the
money my dad saved for me got cut in
half because overnight friends decided
that they were going to devalue our
money by 50 which is a shame
so
look at ghana again right
they have the foreign currencies and
their gold in their own central bank
senegal itself has to ship all the gold
and pretty much all the money or 50 of
it to france to basically manage right
ghana can trade with anybody that they
want in the world
senegal has to go through france first
they like it or not turn it down and
then they can maybe sell it on the
international market which means that
ghana is technically
sovereign economically
and our my country unfortunately senegal
is still dependent on france
we just celebrated our independence last
monday april 4th
but i believe that today in 2022 we are
still under french imperialism and it
really sucks actually right so the city
that that money benefits ghana obviously
and the ghanaian people
and for us the frank cfa unfortunately
benefits like france
right
so
which currency would you rather have
personally i would rather have a
currency that's controlled by africans
that benefits africans ultimately right
but in the end let's say senegal wants
to get off the cfa
are they going to use the city this
money for the from ghana i highly doubt
it we are we are a sovereign country we
don't want to basically use someone
else's currency that might fluctuate or
whatever else actually at the whim of
another government
so for me
i believe actually bitcoin is the answer
in a lot of ways
same as america here we have the usa
united states of america i can go to any
state here oklahoma nevada
new york whatever same people use the
same currency i can trade with anybody
and i can do business with anybody
my wish is for a united states of africa
that's actually my wish but how do we
get there as a matter of fact right how
are we going to make this money who are
we going to trust to basically print
this money for the continent
we can trust nobody because why because
bitcoin is pretty much trustless we
don't have to trust anybody in this
world so how do we basically make sure
that
we can trade we can prosper and we can
help our kids
africa will have the youngest population
in the world by 1950. the average age is
going to be 14 years old
14 years old
right but how are we going to get all
the jobs to these kids and opportunities
themselves
especially if we have corruption and
inflation and all these things
ultimately we need a currency that would
basically unify us
right again right unity united states of
africa how do we make it happen maybe
bitcoin might not be the ultimate answer
but but it's technology that's working
today we can possibly use to help us get
to where we need to get to all right
so
i want to announce
our first africa bitcoin conference in
ghana this year i chose ghana
we're doing it man we're doing it we're
doing it the idea is like i'm from
senegal
i want to have this conference in
senegal we are raising a million dollars
to throw this conference together
why do i want to do it in another
country because i have a problem with
the currency that's in my own country
right so
until we figure out these questions and
enter all these things that basically
surround our currency that's controlled
by the french right we cannot possibly
have this event in senegal so therefore
we're going to ghana and i'm
joined here by florida i don't know
where she at she's in the crowd
uh but please see us later if you want
to have more uh
more questions about it and we'll have
it first week of december and ultimately
we got some sponsors already alex
gladstein i see carrie lee here from
gemini and of course the bitcoin
developers academy my own actually
demand program and we'll be announcing
it for the first week of uh december
and if you want to check it out please
go to afrobitcoin.org or just can't
disqual code and it will get you the
link and hopefully we'll see you in
africa in december in ghana thank you
all right we've been kicking it on the
marathon desk hosted by bitcoin magazine
here live at the bitcoin conference 2022
in miami i'm natalie burnell host of the
coin stories podcast joined by awesome
co-anchors honestly dave cortnoy of
barcelo sports ben askrem former ufc
fighter and alex mcshane of bitcoin
magazine please subscribe to this page
and like this video so other people see
it let's get right to it that was
another great speaker talking really
about the separation i think of money
and state dave what do you think well i
think that's super important and
i also think on the other side of it
what has always worried me a little bit
about bitcoin in the beginning is as
there's a new class of wealth that the
super rich would be like hold on uh
you're not going to become more rich
than i am but i do like the separation i
think it's important
so i first heard this guy speak at oslo
freedom forum and he told this really
interesting story of how he wanted to be
a basketball player so he moved to the
us he wanted to be like michael jordan
and so i mean got some athletes up here
ben what are your thoughts on just you
know the idea that you you don't have to
come from a fancy background you don't
have to come from the elites you don't
have to be a politician bitcoin is for
everybody bitcoin is for everyone i mean
the most important thing that i think he
said and i'm hoping he's factually
correct historically he said 1994 he
came to america yeah and that year his
currency got devalued by 50
yep um i think that's something that a
lot of americans don't understand
because we've experienced that but it's
happened in a lot of countries where you
know their government-backed currency
drops drastically really really quickly
and hey i've been saving for 30 years
and now whatever i have is half or less
and obviously in countries like
venezuela it's going faster than that
it's like every year boom down down down
and so now you have a uh currency which
is separated from the government um
and we're not seeing that with bitcoin
yeah and michael saylor who spoke right
before him he always puts a spotlight on
the fact that you know we see inflation
here but it's way worse in other
countries alex i know this is something
you've talked about so much in your
writings and on your show what do you
think about bitcoin being that defense
strategy against inflation
i think it's a great store of value i
think that here at home i as he
mentioned check alex gladstein's new
book check your financials privilege
points out that here in america
we're not really savvy to this we have
control of the mint here
and we still feel this inflation right
americans are feeling these gas prices
like imagine if another country was
controlling you know you have to
separate money from state it hasn't
always been like this we have to return
to a stateless decentralized currency
and that's that's bitcoin alex do you
think that this is always going to be
you know smaller countries coming in
first and smaller communities that are
pushing the movement or do we need the
big institutions
i think it's a combination i think the
people who understand bitcoin the
quickest are the ones who have a problem
that bitcoin solves they're the one who
identify it as a tool and sometimes you
know people who are you know very
wealthy in us dollars say they might not
get it at first because they just don't
recognize um you know they they have
that privilege they don't they they're
not hurt as much by the inflation
they're just you know
yeah dave i know that you've been back
and forth right you've been more bullish
more bearish now you're back in
apparently the winklevi told you
something that made you sell all your
bitcoin can you share more about that oh
yeah they said that elon musk was going
to outer space and was going to mine
gold from outer space it would rain
plentiful down on earth making gold
useless and uh i was like and for that
reason i'm out i still
sold all of my bitcoin it was 11 000 and
almost coincide directly with like the
bull run
um i don't know what it went to like 30
40 000. it escalated quickly so that was
fascinating because yeah it was marty
bent who a lot of people in the space
know they got you in right he was born
barney bent was a shady character at
barcelona he was working for us oh
we're from barcelona under the guise of
working for barcelona he had a corner
bitcoin office his name at our office
was bitcoin marty we're like what is he
doing
like writing blogs and doing sales and
he was doing bitcoin so
yeah he he actually got me my first
bitcoin on that treasure and i have no
idea where it is or how much it's worth
he probably took it that's because you
were asking questions about treasure
that's the cold storage that's where you
that they won't confiscate it from you
we're a minute away from the next panel
a lot of you guys know this speaker as
well andrew yang who ran for president
is there something that ben you're
looking for in this speech um well
george jorgensen obviously was a
libertarian nominee last year also so uh
probably talking about government and
how bitcoin interacts with it i'm
assuming who's this guy alan farrington
with the chipmunk i don't know him at
all allen farrington's just released a
book on bitcoin okay
what is it anonymous bitcoin is venice
uh no no he'll be here that's great yeah
bitcoin is the renaissance i love it i i
hate to wrap up without mentioning a
bitcoin conference that's going to be
announced in ghana they're going to put
1 million dollars up this is for
senegalese all the west african
countries that are being
screwed over by france and other nations
who control their countries this is
their retaliation they're going to put
one of these in ghana in 2022 in
december i love it and more nation state
